%% wnnTrainer: training algorithm for displacement window learning method
% This is a description
%
% Usage:
%   [WIN, WOUT, fnms] = wnnTrainer(IMG, CNTR, ...
%       nitrs, nsplt, nfigs, NPW, NZP, NLAYERS, TRNFN, sav, vis, par)
%
% Input:
%   IMGS: cell array of images to be trained
%   CNTRS: cell array of contours to train from images
%   nitrs: total recursive interations to train D-Vectors (default 15)
%   nsplt: size of segments to split displacement windows (default 11)
%   nfigs: number of figures opened to show progress of training (default 4)
%   NPW: principal components for folding displacement windows (default 3)
%   NZP: principal components for sampling core patches (default 25)
%   NLAYERS: number of layers to use with fitnet (default 5)
%   TRNFN: training function fitnet (default 'trainlm')
%   sav: boolean to save output as .mat file (1 saves data , 2 saves figures)
%   vis: boolean to visualize output
%   par: boolean to run with parallelization or with single-thread
%
% Output:
%   WIN: input structure containing images, PC scores, and set indices
%   WOUT: output structure containing models and PCA data
%       net: cell array of trained network models for each iteration
%       evecs: cell array of eigenvectors for each iteration
%       mns: cell array of means for each iteration
%   fnms: cell array of file names for the figures generated
